# Designs & Features

This section describes the current PSRL architecture: SMG-based online request
routing, metadata-only sample flow through TransferQueue, asynchronous weight
transfer, and hierarchical KV cache management.

Each subsection covers one major design component, including motivation, architecture, configuration reference, and practical guidance.
